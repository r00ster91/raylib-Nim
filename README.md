Bindings for raylib: http://raylib.com

# Usage
You must use `raylib` as a shared library.

- On Windows you need the `libraylib_shared.dll`
- On Linux you need `libraylib.so`
- On Mac OS X you need `libraylib.dylib`

These shared librarys can be gotten from https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases.

# Notes
- Your source file must share the same location as the shared library
- Desktop only (no iOS, Android or Web, sorry)
- Still a work in progress
